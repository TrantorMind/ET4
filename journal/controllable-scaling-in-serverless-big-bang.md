title: Controllable Scaling in Serverless Big Bang
excerpt: With the appearance of microservice architectures, communication using messages
  become common practice in today’s system design. Tightly coupled monolithic applications
  are rarely the choice of today’s developers or architects. Such applications mostly
  exist as legacy applications, waiting to be discontinued at some point in the near
  future.
